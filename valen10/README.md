## Valen10

Brick breaking game with presents in form of gifs.

I created this while playing with 2D game development using javascript on a Valentines day; Same reason why you see the gifs related to Valentines/day.

This app also works Offline; Only the first time you load the webpage should you be connected to internet. From second time it is optional. Although, to receive updated version of the page you must be Online again.

By the way a quick taal lesson here, number 10 in Dutch is tien(said like teeen). So you see a 10 in this projects name too. And, now, taal in Dutch means language :)

You can play the game at [jan25.github.io/sandbox-2020/valen10](https://jan25.github.io/sandbox-2020/valen10/index.html)
