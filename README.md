## Valen10

Brick breaking game with presents in form of gifs.

I created this while playing with 2D game development using javascript on a Valentines day; Same reason why you see the gifs related to Valentines/day.

By the way a quick taal lesson here, number 10 in Dutch is tien(said like teeen). So you see a 10 in this projects name too. And, now, taal in Dutch means language :)
