## Sudoku

## Ideas

- Latest dropped number will be colored Green if correct
- All incorrect entries will be colored Red
- Cliking on a Green or Red number will remove the number from that cell
- At end of game, the numbers from bottom will collapse to show 'Well Done!'
- We will show a button to play another game below 'Well Done!' message
