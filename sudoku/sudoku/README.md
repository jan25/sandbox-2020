## Sudoku

Sudoku game and generator written in Javascript.

### Ideas

- Latest dropped number will be colored Green if correct
- All incorrect entries will be colored Red
- Cliking on a Green or Red number will remove the number from that cell
- At end of game, the numbers from bottom will collapse to show 'Well Done!'
- We will show a button to play another game below 'Well Done!' message

### TODO

- Remove '0' number from empty cells
- Highlight cell when dragging to drop
- end of game: blinking numbers with 'Well Done' message. Also, with 'new game' button
- Put numbers strip on all 4 sides of grid
