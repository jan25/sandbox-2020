## Sudoku

Sudoku game and generator written in Javascript.

The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3×3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9.

### Ideas

- Latest dropped number will be colored Green if correct
- All incorrect entries will be colored Red
- Cliking on a Green or Red number will remove the number from that cell
- At end of game, the numbers from bottom will collapse to show 'Well Done!'
- We will show a button to play another game below 'Well Done!' message

### TODO

- ~~Remove '0' number from empty cells~~
- ~~Highlight cell when dragging to drop~~
- ~~end of game: blinking numbers with 'Well Done' message. Also, with 'new game' button~~
- ~~Put numbers strip on all 4 sides of grid~~
- ~~Info dialog~~ fix console errors
- Implement generator logic
- Mobile site support
