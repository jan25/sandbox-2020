# Math Recall

A single page web application to remember the math formulas for you. Just create a new formula and use it to calculate results anytime later.

I created this as a learning project while going through React and related libraries.

## Run the application

```
# Download the web application files
$ source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan25/sandbox-2020/master/math-recall/download.sh)
$ cd ./math-recall/math-recall

# Install and start react-dev-server
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
